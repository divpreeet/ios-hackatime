# Hackatime iOS

> [!NOTE]
> this project is still in its early stages! but i've got the main functionality down! 

i really hate going to the hackatime site on my phone, since it really bugs the device, so i took the main information i required from the site( using the api ) and just made it into an ios app!


## current features
login and get stats - done
replicate the card stats - done
get charts working - done
make view responsive - wip
